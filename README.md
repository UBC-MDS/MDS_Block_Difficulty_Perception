### Project Overview

The current MDS cohort contains students from diverse educational and employment backgrounds including Science, Engineering, Arts and Economics. The students also have work experience across Healthcare, IT, Consulting Services, Retail and Financial Industries. Given this we were curious about the overall sentiment students held for blocks 4 and 5. These are generally considered the most difficult blocks of coursework in MDS. Block 4 contains the bulk of the machine learning focus in the degree, with 3 courses focused on aspects of modeling, feature selection and tuning. Block 5 on the other hand, contains primarily statistical coursework in time-series/spatial, bayes, and regression. We decided to traceback a studentâ€™s perception of difficulty for courses in a block based on their educational background because we thought it may be an interesting comparison. We hypothesize that greater familiarity with statistical concepts would lead to a higher difficulty for block 4, whereas a background in computer science may drive a greater sense of difficulty for block 5. Of course, there are several backgrounds we are considering, and this also adds intrigue to our analyses.
